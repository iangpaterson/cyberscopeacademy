					<h4>About Cyberscope Academy</h4>
					<p><small>Cyberscope Academy is an independent privately owned business, based in Aberdeen, specialising in overview as well as boot-camp training programs in the EU GDPR.</small></p>

					<p><small>Cyberscope Academy do not have any affiliation with any other GDPR training organisations but we welcome enquiries from interested parties for international franchise collaboration.</small></p>

					<p><small>No GDPR training can guarantee a career in data privacy. Whilst the IAPP claims that 75,000 vacancies have been created, due to the impact of GDPR, most ask for previous experience in risk, privacy or data protection. The EU GDPR does not mandate that any DPO is qualified only that they have deep knowledge of the regulation.</small></p>

					<p><small>DPO’s do not have to be lawyers, but must have expertise in national and European data protection law, including an in-depth knowledge of the GDPR.</small></p>

					<p><small>Our 3 day GDPR Bootcamp for DPO’s is extremely rigorous, those who do not hold a degree, but have detailed professional experience in the area of risk and/or regulatory compliance, are eligible to apply and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</small></p>
