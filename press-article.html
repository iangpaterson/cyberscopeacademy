			<h1><strong>Change to Data Rules Set to Bring Jobs Boom</strong></h1>
			<h2>Opportunity for professionals</h2>
			<h5 class="firstParagraph"><em>The Press &amp; Journal (Aberdeen) 12th Aug 2017</em></h5>
			<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="img/colin-p&j.jpg" height="301" alt="Portrait image of Colin Rawlinson">
			<p>A veteran Aberdeen recruitment specialist says new data protection regulations could bring a jobs boom for unemployed oil and gas professionals.</p>
			<p>Colin Rawlinson is launching a crowdfunding campaign to help people who are out of work because of the North Sea downturn to retrain for the posts that he expects to be created.</p>
			<p>Under the EU General Data Protection Regulations (EU GDPR) every company will be required to have a full or part-time data protection officer from May next year.</p>
			<p>Westhill-based Mr Rawlinson, who has 43 years' experience in oil and gas recruitment, said:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> Not since the discovery of the first oil in the North Sea have I witnessed a jobs boom for displaced professionals like big data and data privacy. I want to create jobs for unemployed oil and gas professionals by making the public more aware of their data privacy rights, including the right to be forgotten and the right to know what your personal data is being used for. <i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Mr Rawlinson is already providing short courses in the required skills through his Cyberscope Academy business for former oil and gas workers who qualify for funding from Scottish Government agency Skills Development Scotland (SDS).</p>
			<p>But he has turned to the online Crowdfunder platform in a bid to raise an initial £15,000 to create a fund that can be used by people who do not qualify for the SDS support. He added that the target sum was “seed funding” for the project and he hoped to raise more to expand the training.</p>
			<p>Industry organisation the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) has claimed there is a need for an additional 75,000 people to help firms meet the requirements of the new regulations. Estimates suggest that the global data privacy market is worth around £2billion.</p>
			<p>Mr Rawlinson continued:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> I have a passion for helping people to use their transferable skills to get jobs in new industries. No technology experience is required for these positions and the regulations do not insist on any industry qualifications to work as a data protection officer. I want to create real job opportunities in Aberdeen by offering free or subsidised job coaching and GDPR training for anyone who has been unemployed for more than six months. <i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The Cyberscope Academy is offering four-day training programmes, which lead to certification as a data protection practitioner.</p>

			<p>Mr Rawlinson, who says he has read more than one million CVs and been responsible for hiring more than 10,000 people in 17 countries during his career with the oil and gas industry, said he was “deeply saddened” by the number of people who had lost their jobs during the downturn in recent years.</p>
